# WorkShop_Calculator

Retro coding ! An app collection for the machinist, developped back in the days for Windows CE/Mobile !

French only.

I still use these apps in the workshop. Cutting conditions for milling, tapping, turning, drilling + some other widgets.

It was developped using Windows XP/7 32 bits, with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 to 2008, for Windows CE 2003 and Mobile up to 6. Visual Studio 2008 was the last realease allowing development for Windows CE. Not sure it could be installed over Windows 10, or in a virtual machine running Windows XP or 7. Support for all resolutions, aspect ratios and orientations ("resolution aware")

These apps still works great...

 SD_card folder : all executables and an autorun : just insert the card in one of these old devices, and the laucher app will pop up.
