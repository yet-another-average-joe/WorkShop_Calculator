# WorkShop_Calculator
Retro coding ! An app collection for the machinist, developped back in the days for Windows CE/Mobile !

I still use these apps in the workshop. Cutting conditions for milling, tapping, turning, drilling + some other widgets.

In french only. Sources are a mess and will need to be sorted before release (versioning...).

It was developped using Windows XP/7 32 bits, with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and 2007, for Windows CE 2003 and Mobile up to 6. Visual Studio 2007 was the last realease allowing development for Windows CE. Not sure it could be installed over Windows 10, or in a virtual machine running Windows XP or 7.

These apps still works great...

Sources will be released in a next future. For now, you will find the copy of the SD card, with its autorun. Just insert the SD card in one of these old devices, and the main app will pop up. The OS has to be at least WindowsCE 2003. The apps are resolution and orientation aware.
